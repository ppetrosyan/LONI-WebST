LONI Pipeline Web-based Server Terminal
=======================================

Background/Motivation:

LONI (Laboratory of Neuro Imaging) is a laboratory at UCLA that is dedicated to the development of scientific approaches for the comprehensive mapping of brain structure and function.  LONI maintains a distributed software system called the LONI Pipeline.  This system allows users to design, validate and execute computational workflows.  LONI provides system adminstrators with the ability to monitor and configure the Pipeline system in real time using a desktop application called the LONI Pipeline Server Terminal.  However, this application is user unfriendly and platform dependent.
